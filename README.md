This project successfully developed a web application that allows users to search for YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API v3. The implementation ensures smooth functionality with proper error handling, preventing crashes and providing clear feedback for issues like invalid API keys, no search results, and internet connection failures. The addition of filtering and pagination enhances user experience, making the search process more efficient and user-friendly.
